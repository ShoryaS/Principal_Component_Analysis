The goal of this analysis is not to improve accuracy or minimize loss function. It showcases the power of Principal Component Technique to reduce the computational time required when there are large number of input features.

In this case there are '41' features originally, out of which only '10' are selected which has 90% variance in input data.

From the analysis it was concluded that the computational time reduced by several times after applying PCA and selecting 10 principal components and the variables are transformed to a new set of linearly uncorrelated variables.
